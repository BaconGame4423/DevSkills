  name: "function-plot"
  description: "D3.js-based 2D function plotting library with built-in derivative visualization support. Provides interactive graphs with automatic re-evaluation on scale changes and mouse-following tangent line updates."
  rationale: "Directly satisfies FR-001 through FR-010 by providing native support for function graphing, derivative display with updateOnMouseMove, tangent line visualization, and real-time updates. Uses interval-arithmetic for pixel-perfect rendering of oscillating functions."

  name: "math.js"
  description: "Comprehensive JavaScript math library with symbolic computation capabilities including derivative calculation via math.derivative(). Features flexible expression parser supporting all required functions (sin, cos, tan, log, exp, sqrt, abs)."
  rationale: "Essential for FR-007 (derivative calculation) and FR-012 (error handling). The derivative function returns symbolic expressions like '2*x + 1' from 'x^2 + x', enabling both display and evaluation. Expression parser handles invalid syntax gracefully."

  description: "Industry-standard JavaScript visualization library for creating custom interactive data visualizations. Provides SVG/Canvas rendering, scales, axes, zoom, and brush interactions."
  rationale: "function-plot is built on D3.js, making it a required dependency. D3's zoom behavior (d3-zoom) enables FR-004 (auto zoom/scale) and mobile pinch-zoom for FR-011 (responsive design). d3-brush supports interactive region selection."

  description: "Standalone debounce utility from Lodash. Creates a debounced function that delays invoking the provided function until after the specified wait time has elapsed since the last call."
  rationale: "Directly implements FR-003 requirement for 300ms debounce on real-time graph updates. Prevents excessive re-rendering during typing, ensuring SC-002 (less than 100ms latency after typing stops). 27M+ weekly downloads demonstrates battle-tested reliability."

  description: "Use browser's requestAnimationFrame API for cursor-following tooltip updates to ensure smooth 30+ FPS rendering. Throttle tooltip position calculations to animation frames rather than every mousemove event."
  rationale: "Essential for FR-009 (cursor-following tooltip) and SC-006 (minimum 30fps updates). Raw mousemove events fire faster than screen refresh, causing janky updates. RAF synchronizes updates with browser paint cycle for smooth 60fps capability on capable displays."
